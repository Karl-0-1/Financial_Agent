# üìà AI Financial Analyst Agent

This project is a conversational AI agent that acts as a junior financial analyst. It uses the LangChain framework with Google's Gemini models to answer complex financial questions.

The agent can autonomously use a set of tools to:
* Fetch live stock data (`yfinance`)
* Search for recent financial news (`NewsAPI`)
* Perform sentiment analysis on news headlines (using `Gemini`)

This project is built with Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
